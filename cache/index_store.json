Also, exclude the selvage of any polywrap covering (see 201.5.3) from this determination. Mailers must secure nonpaper contents to prevent shifting of more than 2 inches within the mailpiece if shifting would cause the piece to be nonuniform in thickness or would result in the contents bursting out of the mailpiece (see 601.3.3). 2.5Ineligible Flat-Size Pieces Flat-size mailpieces that do not meet the eligibility standards in 2.3 and 2.4 are considered parcels, and customers mailing these pieces must pay the applicable parcel prices. 3.0Physical Standards for Parcels 3.1Processing Categories USPS categorizes parcels into one of three mail processing categories: machinable, irregular, or nonmachinable parcel.

Examples of evidence that you should tell us about or give to us that may affect how we assign a disability evaluation include the following: • Statements discussing your disability symptoms from people who have witnessed how the symptoms affect you. • Information about on-going treatment records, including VA or other Federal treatment records, you have not previously told us about; • Social Security determinations; • Statements from employers as to job performance, lost time, or other information regarding how your condition(s) affect your ability to work; OR If VA received your claim prior to or within one year of your separation from the military, entitlement will be from the day following the date of your separation as long as the disability was present at that time.

IMPORTANT: For additional benefits to be payable for a child, the veteran must be entitled to compensation and evaluated as 30 percent or more disabling. HOW VA DETERMINES THE DISABILITY RATING. When we find disabilities to be service-connected, we assign a disability rating. That rating can be changed if there are changes in your condition. Depending on the disability involved, we will assign a rating from 0 percent to as much as 100 percent. VA uses a schedule for evaluating disabilities that is published as title 38, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 4. In rare cases, we can assign a disability level other than the levels found in the schedule for a specific condition if your impairment is not adequately covered by the schedule.

In addition, if you receive a Voluntary Separation Incentive (VSI), your VSI payments may be reduced if you are awarded VA compensation.

However, to be legally entitled to keep your training pay, you must waive VA benefits for the number of days equal to the number of days for which you received training pay. In most instances, it will be to your advantage to waive your VA benefits and keep your training pay.  If you waive VA benefits to receive training pay by checking the box in Item 28, VA will retroactively adjust your VA award to withhold benefits equal to the total number of training days waived and at the monthly rate in effect for the fiscal year period for which you received training pay. This action may result in an overpayment of compensation, which may be subject to collection.","metadataSeparator":"\n","type":"TEXT"},"33d43c0b-db15-4a19-9d4d-ea2f559194b0":{"id_":"33d43c0b-db15-4a19-9d4d-ea2f559194b0","metadata":{},"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys":[],"excludedLlmMetadataKeys":[],"relationships":{"SOURCE":{"nodeId":"./data/101.pdf","metadata":{},"hash":"Y0rf+lbPYJHPnjjzbPEuiGz9QC6HJHidGCdR2a1kkKc="},"PREVIOUS":{"nodeId":"2bcb5014-54e5-49d6-8427-833b89d1389a","metadata":{},"hash":"7k8J9zqxSXJXxMsdmhOO6AsfkSO0qt4RkFmNm2wni8g="},"NEXT":{"nodeId":"9d781090-c6d1-47da-a805-b2c644098d8c","metadata":{},"hash":"9FTXsn1ltFWHMZCpfa01V4ZODv08ztvOPM5CfYqCDTc="}},"hash":"r5+L/jDFamWCBNBybJZ4yyLjYiuXCPEx8E6KANdw5JY=","text":"This action may result in an overpayment of compensation, which may be subject to collection.
